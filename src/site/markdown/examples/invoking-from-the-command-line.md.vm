Invoking from the command line
==============================

This plugin can be invoked from the command line this way:

    mvn ${project.groupId}:${project.artifactId}:${project.version}:file -Dfile=the-file-to-process

This will calculate and output the checksum of `the-file-to-process` for every algorithm supported by the plugin.
